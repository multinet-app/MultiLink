                    The purpose of this research study is to examine the data analysis practices of Multivariate Networks. 
                    We are completing this study in order to articulate the strengths and weaknesses of different representations of network visualizations.
                    </p>

                <p>
                        If you agree, you will participate in a series of tests to assess how you interact with a particular visualization of social network data. 
                        The study should take about 45 minutes. Your participation is completely voluntary. 
                        You may choose not to answer a question or are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the interview at any time for any reason. 
                        There are no known risks associated with participating in this study.                    
                </p>

                    <p>
                        By participating in this study, you will help provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of specific graph
                         representations and improve data analysts' ability to understand their own graph data. 
                         Additionally, this will lay the foundation for further research on the benefits of other graph representations.  
                        </p>

                     <p>
                    The answers you submit and data about your performance (such as the time it took to answer and interactions prior to answer submission) will be digitally recorded. 
                    Only interactions on the experiment page will be tracked. After the completion of the study, no other data will be recorded. 
                    These records will be coded and a participant ID will be used to connect performance across tasks. 
                    This data will be stored on a secure research database. You will not be identified in any publications.
                    </p>
